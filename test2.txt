        The desert seems vast, even endless, and yet scientists tell us that somewhere, even now, there is snow.

        Welcome to Night Vale. 
        <br>
        The Night Vale Tourism Board’s “Visit-able Night Vale” campaign has kicked off with posters encouraging folks to take their family on a scenery-filled jaunt through the trails of Radon Canyon.
        <br>
        Their slogan? “The view is literally breathtaking.”
        <br>
        Posters will be placed at police stations and frozen yogurt shops in nearby towns, along with promotional giveaways of plastic sheeting and re-breathers.
        <br>
        And now, the news.
